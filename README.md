This is a program that creates a python script in the current working directory. The program will add the standard modules that you know you are always going to put to use.

# setupJS.py
To work around the annoyance to always set up a html file with a corresponding JavaScript file. This script will make the two files automatically in the current working directory
with a single click on the python file.
