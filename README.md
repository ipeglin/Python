# Python Scripts

## Generators

### createPy.py
This is a program that creates a python script in the current working directory. The program will add the standard modules that you know you are always going to put to use.

### setupJS.py
To work around the annoyance to always set up a html file with a corresponding JavaScript file. This script will make the two files automatically in the current working directory
with a single click on the python file.

### generatePasswordV2.py
This is the second version of the password generator. Instead of giving the user a choice of the percentage of numbers in the password, it is made more simple by just specifying the length of the password. The file path is also specified to the home folder of the current user.


## Automation

### cleanDir.py
A script that automatically organizes the directory that the script is currently placed in. The directories that the script will place files into are pre-set, and the script needs to be modified if you want others.

### cleanDirV2.py
An updated version of cleanDir.py where the code is more managable for future development and folder additions. The program also features a user feedback which is bit easier to read.
